# Credit Risk Analysis

*2022*
<br>

This project consists of building a model to better understand what factors come into play surrounding credit risk. 

In the repo, the end to end work done from data ingestion to model optimization will be found, along with model deployment onto a [Streamlit web app](https://share.streamlit.io/arhumzafar/credit_risk_analysis/main/credit_risk_app.py).
